Project Documentation: Spring Quiz Web Application
________________________________________
Introduction
This project is focused on developing a robust full-stack web application that enables users to participate in a Spring Quiz. The application implements a secure credential verification system using a username and password. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the quiz interface. The quiz questions, corresponding answers, and user scores are stored in a MySQL database. Interaction with the API is facilitated through a well-designed web client built using Thymeleaf.
